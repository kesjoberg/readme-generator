# Homework 9: README Generator
## Objective:

The objective of this assignment was to use JavaScript, Node, Inquirer and fs to create a professional README.md file using a series of prompts. 

We were provided with the skeloton index.js and generateMarkdown.js files. I started by working on the generateMarkdown file by creating the functions to determine whether to include the license section and badge based on the user's choice. Next, I created function to create the README file by using template literals and the responses from the questions, which allowed me to know which questions to ask on the index.js file. After completing the sections, I finished the functions to start the file and write the file.
