## Description
The objective of this project was to create a professional README generator where the user responds to a series of prompts in the node terminal and then the application creates a README file for the user with all the sections.

## Installation
You will need to create a branch and clone it to your local computer.

## Usage
Open the project in your integrated terminal. Then, run an npm install. Next, type 'node index.js' in the terminal to start answering the prompts. The application will do the rest of the work for you and write your work to a README.md file.
